# Big Note:
Currently working on another project, so I have to pause Storayge development for now. I would love to show the other project as well but I kinda have to keep it private which is a bummer.

# Storayge


## Objective
This app aims to become a storage management app which can be used to manage the user's belongings and items. This app should (but is not limited to) used to manage long-term storage.

---

## What must this app have?
This app must be **fast, easy to use, simple, fluid, and comprehensive**. This app is designed with the assumption that 10 year olds might also use this app. Essentially, I aim to make this app both **simple** but **advanced** enough to be used **comfortably** and **proffessionally**. Sounds like a fever dream *I know*, but having a huge goal is a great step forward yeah? (´▽`ʃ♡ƪ)

## Features

1. User can create **Groups**.
2. User can add **Items** inside the **Group**.
3. User can use **Text Recognition** to quickly find and identify their items.
4. User can search for all the **Groups** and **Items** that they have created.
